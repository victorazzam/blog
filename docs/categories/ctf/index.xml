The front page description won&amp;rsquo;t do it justice as time passes and this nerdy diary of artless prose fills to the brim.
Getting closer to the point This isn&amp;rsquo;t to say that the blog is purely tech-based or security-related. Indeed it will be a recurring theme, largely due to how much less effort it takes to type stuff (code) and then type some more (this blog) to discuss said stuff.</description></item></channel></rss>
